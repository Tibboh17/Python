# Idea
- Use counting sort.
- Because of Time Limit Exceed and Memory Limit Exceed, make the code simple.

# Code
```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

arr = [0 for _ in range(10001)]

for _ in range(int(input())):
    arr[int(input())] += 1
    
for i in range(10001):
    if arr[i] != 0:
        for j in range(arr[i]):
            print(i)
```
